# 1. Why $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ is Called the "Score Function"

The gradient of the log-density with respect to the data, $\nabla_x \log p(x)$, is known as the **score function** (or simply the **score**) of the probability density $p$.

## Historical Reason

- The term "score" originates from **R. A. Fisher** in the 1920s–1930s in the context of **maximum likelihood estimation**.
- Fisher defined the score as the gradient of the log-likelihood with respect to the **parameters** $\theta$:  
  $s(\theta) = \nabla_\theta \log \mathcal{L}(\theta; x)$.
- He used the word "score" to describe how strongly the data "pulls" the parameter estimate in a certain direction.
- Over time (influenced by Rao and others), "score function" became standard terminology for this gradient.
- In modern machine learning (especially since Hyvärinen's 2005 work on **score matching**), the term was extended to the gradient with respect to the **data** $x$: $\nabla_x \log p(x)$.  
  It is sometimes called the **Stein score** or **data score**, but "score function" has persisted due to historical precedent and mathematical analogy.

## Scientific / Mathematical Reason

The name is well-justified by several key properties:

1. **Direction of steepest ascent** in the log-density landscape — points toward higher-probability regions.
2. **Zero mean** under the distribution: $\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p} [\nabla_x \log p(x)] = 0$ (under regularity conditions).
3. **Connection to Fisher information** — the (negative) expected Hessian of the log-density relates to local curvature, analogous to the parameter case.
4. **Normalizing-constant free** — for unnormalized models $p(x) \propto \exp(-E(x))$, the score is $-\nabla_x E(x)$, computable without the partition function.
5. **Enables score matching** — powerful training objective (e.g., denoising score matching) used in modern generative models like diffusion models.

In summary, the score $\nabla_x \log p(x)$ "scores" the local geometry of the probability distribution, guiding movement along the density surface — a direct parallel to Fisher's original parameter-score.
